This code gives the algorithm for cleaning the dryad data. In particular, the dryad data is used to compute India's GDP at PPP and HDI index. The dryad data is a global data at the grid level. We need to make a data panel with GDP and HDI measurements for all pin codes in India. Granularity at that level makes much of the study convenient and can be traced at a micro-level, facilitating an understanding of the heterogeneity of income and expenditure in India. This R code uses the dryad NC file to trace the data for India using the latitude and longitude and extract them for the variables of interest. Further, using pincode shape files and spatial merge using a coordinate reference system, the data could be traced at the pincode level.
